# Build a Shopify app using Remix

This is a Shopify app for managing QR codes. It is the code for the [Build a Shopify app using Remix tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/build-qr-code-app).

You can [follow the tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/build-qr-code-app), or just browse the code.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
1. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don’t have one.
1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Setup

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run setup
```

### Local Development

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Press P to open the URL to your app. Once you click install, you can start development.

Local development is powered by [the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli). It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.

### Build

Remix handles building the app for you, by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

### Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

When you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Tech Stack

This template uses [Remix](https://remix.run). The following Shopify tools are also included to ease app development:

- [Shopify App Remix](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/blob/main/packages/shopify-app-remix/README.md) provides authentication and methods for interacting with Shopify APIs.
- [Shopify App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge) allows your app to seamlessly integrate your app within Shopify's Admin.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Webhooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/add_remix_package/packages/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-webhook-requests): Callbacks sent by Shopify when certain events occur
